I'll create an artifact to fix the webpack configuration and canvas module issues.

Fix Konva and canvas module configuration

Revert

package.json
npm install
next.config.js
rm -rf .next && npm install
npm run dev
The changes:

Updated package.json to ensure konva and react-konva dependencies are properly listed
Configured webpack in next.config.js to:
Handle canvas module for client-side only
Properly alias Konva's Node.js specific imports
Externalize problematic modules for server build
Cleaned up the .next directory and reinstalled dependencies
Restarted the development server
This should resolve the canvas module resolution issues and webpack caching errors.

Bolt has tried to resolve the problems.

I'll help you resolve these Webpack caching errors by clearing the Next.js build cache and restarting the development server.

Clear Next.js build cache

Undo

rm -rf .next
npm run dev
This will:

Remove the corrupted .next directory containing the problematic Webpack cache
Start a fresh development server which will rebuild the cache from scratch
The development server should now start without the caching errors. Let me know if you see any other issues!
